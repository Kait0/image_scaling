# image_scaling
A high performance image scaling algorithm, that crops part of an image and scales it to the desired resolution.
Implemented both in RISC assembler and C.
Developed together with my fellow students Vadim Goryainov and Jeremi Trzeciecki as part of the course Aspects of low-level programming for games development.
